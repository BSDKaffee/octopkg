## This is OctoPkg, a powerful pkgng front-end using Qt libs.

You'll need "git" and "qt5" packages in order to get latest dev version!

To download the source code, type:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/aarnt/octopkg
$ cd octopkg
$ /usr/local/lib/qt5/bin/qmake
$ make
```

To run it:

```
$ bin/octopkg
```

You'll also need a privilege escalation tool called "octopkg-sudo" available on "sudo" folder.

Enjoy!
