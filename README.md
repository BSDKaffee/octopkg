## This is OctoPkg, a powerful pkgng front-end using Qt libs.

![Main window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aarnt/octopkg/master/octopkg-mainwindow.png)

You'll need "git" and "qt5" packages in order to get latest dev version!

To download the source code, type:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/aarnt/octopkg
$ cd octopkg
$ /usr/local/lib/qt5/bin/qmake
$ make
# make install
```

To run it:

```
$ octopkg
```

You'll also need a privilege escalation tool called "octopkg-sudo" available on "sudo" folder.

Enjoy!
