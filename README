This is OctoPkg, a powerful pkgng front-end using Qt libs. 
================================================================

The project's source code is hosted at 
	https://github.com/aarnt/octopkg.

You'll need a privilege escalation tool to use it, once running as 
root will ONLY work in KDE. OctoPkg supports kdesu and gksu for that.

Enjoy!
